  # SportButique

  The project is the development of an online sporting goods store.
  
  It is built on the basis of Angular CLI.
  For database / authentication and user registration a Firebase / Angular-Fire is used.

  In project are use:

- RxJs, Components, Modules, sevices
- Routing navigation
- Reactive forms
- Attribute and Structural directives.


    As a functionality, for the online store are used methods for registration and authentication of the user, 
    guards for the administrator, 
    as well as the main CRUD operations.

    The site has 3 views - for unregistered user, registered user and administrator.
    The unregistered user can view the items without the possibility of purchasing through the online platform, except through the left contact     form.

    Registration user can purchase items.
    
    The administrator has access to create, edit and delete items.

##To start the project you need a browser, an editor and the command ng serve / ng s.
